# libft

This is the first project at 42 school. We must create our own custom library using both standard functions and some new custom ones. This is to both get a better understanding of standard C functions that are used regurlarly but also to use later in our projects.

I have also included in my library, my get_next_line project and printf project that we must also complete. This is for use in other projects also.
