# Cube3D

Cube3D is a **C** project inspired by **Wolfenstein 3D**, developed as part of the **42 School curriculum**. The goal is to create a basic 3D game engine with raycasting to simulate 3D environments in real-time, allowing the player to navigate a maze.

## Project Description

Cube3D is a raycasting-based game engine where the player can navigate through a 3D maze. The project introduces 3D rendering techniques, raycasting, texture mapping, and game logic. It is a simple, but effective example of how 3D environments can be created using 2D maps and raycasting.

## Features

- Real-time 3D rendering using raycasting.
- Player movement within a 3D maze.
- Textured walls and interactive environment.
- Basic game mechanics (collision detection, movement, etc.).

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/cube3d.git
cd cube3d
make
```

## Usage
./cube3d maps/[sample_map.cub]
