Key points

* We will check if all of the map details have been given otherwise it is returned as a invalid map. Each of these are stored in their own char points and can be accessed at a later point.

* I have used enum to check the type, i.e. north, south etc. We will use strcmp to ensure they are the correct files next to NO, SO and the other signifyers.

* Regarding RGB values, I will do a further check to see if they are valid integers.

* We will then take the floor and ceiling RGB char values and convert them into integers to be used as corresponding RGB values.
