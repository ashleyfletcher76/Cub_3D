Key points

* The background function renders a 2D grid map. We distinguish grid lines by using the modulus operation to make the grid lines even.

* The non_grid_lines function makes every cell distinct when meeting certain conditons, i.e. '1' will be walls(white), '0' will be inside the map perimiter(black) and any remainder grid, like spaces as grey.
